              "I first came to volunteer at Where Rainbows Meet in 2022, and I’ve returned every year since. From my very first visit, I felt genuinely welcomed and immediately inspired to support the incredible work they do in the community. I originally joined to assist with the computer training classes, but naturally found myself getting involved in other areas too, including the ECD centre, the food programme, and the football activities. What makes Rainbows so special is the people; everyone is loving, caring and incredibly welcoming. Staying with a host family made the experience even more meaningful, and over time they’ve begun to feel like a second family to me. Every time I leave, I find myself wanting to come back. Volunteering here has not only been deeply meaningful on a personal level but has also strengthened my CV and become a genuine talking point in job applications since graduating. It’s an amazing organisation at the heart of an amazing community, and I’m grateful to be part of it."

              "My time at Where Rainbows Meet in October 2024 was incredibly positive and rewarding. I mainly was based in the head office working alongside Fatiema, Kyle and Mymoena who gave me the support I needed. The staff and beneficiaries were a joy to meet every day, and I felt very safe in the organisation’s campus in Vrygrond. The women in the sewing centre had the most incredible stories about their lives and the kids in the ECD were so sweet and joyful. The focus the staff at Rainbows have to meet the needs of the beneficiaries and local community is incredibly clear to see - there’s always multiple activities going on in the  classrooms, soup kitchen, sewing centre and ITC lab in the Rainbows campus, so the campus constantly feels busy and alive. My advice when interning or volunteering would be to use your initiative: Where/who can you ask for help? How can you work around language barriers? If you don’t have anything at hand to do, can you walk around the campus to help out any staff? Feel free to contact me on Instagram (@g.gjaswal) to further chat to me about my experience!!"
